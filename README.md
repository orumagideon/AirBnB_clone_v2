AirBnB clone - MySQL
Project Name: AirBnB Clone (HBNB)

This repository represents the initial stage of a student project aiming to replicate the AirBnB website. It introduces a backend console to manage program data. The console facilitates creation, updating, and deletion of objects and file storage management through JSON serialization/deserialization for persistent storage.

The Command Interpreter:

The command interpreter offers a REPL interface for interaction with project models and supported storage engines. To utilize it:

Clone the repository.
Locate and run the "console.py" file using the command ./console.py.
Commands available within the console allow for various actions like creating, showing, updating, and destroying instances of models.

Supported Models:

The project includes several models such as User, State, City, Amenity, Place, and Review. These models represent different aspects of the AirBnB concept.

Environment Variables:

The system utilizes environment variables for settings like the running environment, MySQL server details, and storage type.

Examples:

The readme provides examples demonstrating command syntax and usage for creating, showing, destroying, and updating instances of different models.

Project Testing:

Before committing any changes, it's recommended to run the ./test.bash script to ensure code compliance with the project's styling standard and to prevent test failures.

For detailed information and further instructions, refer to the full readme file.
